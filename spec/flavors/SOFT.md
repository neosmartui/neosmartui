# Soft Flavor Contract

Soft is the calm application-oriented NeoSmartUI flavor for long-session interfaces. It preserves visible structure, direct contrast, tactile depth, obvious affordance, and physical micro-interaction while reducing the visual aggression of the flagship Hardline expression.

## Stable identity

- Flavor ID: `flavor.soft`
- Flavor schema: `neosmartui/flavor@1`
- Implemented light Theme: `packages/themes/soft-light/theme.json`
- Implemented dark Theme: `packages/themes/soft-dark/theme.json`
- Interaction model: `pressure-not-levitation`
- Flavor maturity: `public-proof`
- Soft Light maturity: `public-proof`
- Soft Dark maturity: `implemented`
- Soft Dark public-proof status: **not public-proof yet**
- Public-proof record: `evidence/public/flavor.soft.json`

## Expression contract

Soft defaults toward moderate rounding, visible moderate boundaries, shallow hard structural depth, warm neutral application surfaces, softened blue accent intent, readable system-first typography, comfortable application density, seated persistent selection, and restrained motion. Hover begins compression toward the resting plane; direct press completes compression. Soft MUST NOT introduce generic hover lift.

Raised controls may express tactile hard-shadow depth. Recessed editing/data surfaces remain seated rather than pretending to be raised pressable controls. Informational surfaces remain stable. Motion is reserved for affordance, pressure, selection, progress, confirmation, and failure rather than decorative hover movement.

Flavor-owned expression may configure palette defaults, typography, geometry, border weight, shadow direction/strength, density, spacing personality, motion intensity/release, icon treatment, surface treatment, and patterns.

Soft MUST NOT own Button/Dialog/Product/Checkout/Billing behavior, SaaS workspace/billing semantics, or any other Core/Vertical behavior. The legacy source called itself a SaaS/application flavor, but NeoSmartUI extracts only its visual/physical personality; SaaS remains a Vertical under the Canonical PRD.

## Soft Light implementation

`Soft Light` is a concrete schema-valid `neosmartui/theme@1` implementation. Its resolution is explicit and machine-readable:

- `packages/themes/soft-light/tokens.json`
- `packages/themes/soft-light/resolution.json`
- exact scope: the current 18 implemented/public-proof Core components
- exact resolved semantic dependency union: 55 token IDs
- generated CSS scope: `.ns-theme-soft-light`

The implementation resolves visible `2px` structural boundaries, `8px` control radius, `12px` surface radius, pill annotation geometry, a coherent `3px → 1.5px → 0px` structural depth model with matching `0px → 1.5px → 3px` inward travel, and restrained `70ms / 105ms / 165ms` press/release/standard timing. Controls retain a `44px` minimum target and an independent `3px` focus keyline with `3px` offset.

Soft Light uses independently resolved warm neutral surfaces and a softened-blue primary action while keeping written state meaning, semantic HTML, accessibility behavior, RTL behavior, reduced-motion behavior, forced-colors behavior, and Core interaction semantics in the shared adapters. The Foundry route `apps/foundry/src/flavors/soft/index.html` imports the same shipping Button/Input/Card/Badge adapter CSS used by other flavors; no Soft component implementation fork exists.

## Soft Dark implementation

`Soft Dark` is the second concrete Theme instance of `flavor.soft`. It is implemented as an authored semantic Dark Theme, not CSS inversion, filter-based dark mode, or hidden conditional values inside Soft Light.

Soft Dark resolves the same exact shipping 18-Core / 55-token semantic dependency boundary through the same shared Core adapters:

- `packages/themes/soft-dark/tokens.json`
- `packages/themes/soft-dark/resolution.json`
- exact scope: the same 18 Core components as Soft Light
- exact resolved semantic dependency union: 55 token IDs
- generated CSS scope: `.ns-theme-soft-dark`
- proof-safe demo fragment: `apps/foundry/fragments/soft-dark.html`
- canonical route: `/flavors/soft/`

The non-color Soft laws remain identical across Light and Dark:

- visible `2px` control, surface, and annotation boundaries;
- moderate `8px` control radius, `12px` grouped-surface radius, and pill annotation geometry;
- `3px → 1.5px → 0px` structural depth for rest → hover → active;
- `0px → 1.5px → 3px` inward travel;
- `70ms / 105ms / 165ms` pressure timings;
- `44px` minimum interactive target;
- independent `3px` focus keyline with `3px` offset;
- comfortable application density;
- readable system-first typography;
- seated persistent selection;
- reduced-motion state acknowledgement without non-essential travel;
- forced-colors, keyboard, touch, pointer, RTL, localization, and narrow-layout conformance.

The authored Soft Dark semantic palette is NeoSmartUI-owned and independently contrast-validated:

- interactive surface `#1e1b19` and panel `#292522`;
- primary content `#f7f1e8` and secondary content `#c7bfb5`;
- default/strong boundaries `#b8afa5` / `#f3ebe2`;
- softened-blue primary action `#8fb8f4` with dark content `#171513`;
- success `#8ed0aa`, warning `#e7c66c`, error `#e88983`, and info `#b7a4e5` with explicit written labels;
- focus ring `#9ec4ff` independent of action color.

The dedicated validator requires at least 4.5:1 for text/content pairings and at least 3:1 for focus/boundary non-text contrast. Status meaning remains written and semantic; color is never the only carrier of meaning.

The proven Light source route remains byte-identical. `tooling/foundry/build.mjs` generates `soft-dark-theme.css` and deterministically assembles `apps/foundry/fragments/soft-dark.html` into the copied `/flavors/soft/` artifact after the proven Light source route is copied. No `flavor.soft-dark` identity, `/flavors/soft-dark/` route, renderer fork, or component fork exists.

Soft Dark is implemented but not public-proof. The existing `evidence/public/flavor.soft.json` continues to bind only the already-deployed Soft Light inputs until a later exact merged-main artifact is deployed and natively verified. No Pages deployment occurs from the implementation branch.

## Contract history

The preceding lifecycle stage intentionally carried the marker `Soft Dark contract maturity: `contract-only`` and the rule “Concrete Dark palette values are intentionally deferred” until the contract merged green and mandatory merged-main Quality passed. Those contract-only statements are now superseded by the implementation above; they are retained here solely as lifecycle history and validator evidence, not as current maturity.

The contract established that Soft Dark is the second concrete Theme instance of `flavor.soft`, must preserve the exact shipping 18-Core / 55-token semantic dependency boundary, and must not mutate the existing `/flavors/soft/` proof source. Those boundaries remain authoritative in implementation.

## Public-proof cohort

Soft Light reached `public-proof` only after implementation merged and the exact merged-main artifact was independently verified and deployed without rebuilding. Its original proof lifecycle used:

- implementation source `neosmartui/neosmartui@5e999f2e62dc7727ebb74a9c79c5bd40513d6d0d`
- merged-main Quality run `34707268277`
- merged-main browser artifact `10301797631`
- Chromium `105/105`
- Pages commit `ff7723951ff1eba3a6890ce57f71eeb2646f524a`
- Pages tree `24f8086b988db5aaa97c6bba44c4f8f35dcf6c95`
- native Pages run `34707560564`

The singleton public-proof cohort has since advanced as later verified Flavor work deployed. `evidence/public/flavor.soft.json` is the machine-readable authority for Soft's current cohort and retains exact implementation blob bindings. Public-proof promotion never redeploys Pages.

## Migration provenance

The primary legacy knowledge source is pinned as `NeoBrutalism-shop/NeoBrutal-Soft@dfed77bd159ac5c38081f7a4ca5c2229b61ffb8a`, especially `DESIGN.md`. The migration ledger classifies `legacy.soft.design-language` as `ADAPT` into the Flavor layer and explicitly says to extract Soft visual personality without importing SaaS domain semantics.

The pinned source describes coated-plastic / soft-touch hardware, visible `2px` default structural borders, moderate rounding, shallow hard depth with reference rest → hover → active geometry of `3px → 1.5px → 0px`, warm neutral surfaces, softened blue accents, restrained motion, and dark mode as a first-class Theme rather than an inversion filter. These are migration knowledge inputs; NeoSmartUI resolves its own semantic token values and copies no legacy implementation source.

Repository metadata for that legacy source does not declare a license. The migration policy therefore remains `knowledge-only-until-reviewed`, and no legacy CSS/JS/React implementation bytes are imported.

## Next lifecycle stage

After this implementation PR passes exact-head Quality with the browser suite increased from 124 to 130 and merges, mandatory merged-main Quality must pass again. Only then may the exact merged-main artifact be independently verified and deployed byte-for-byte without rebuilding. Native Pages verification must confirm those exact bytes, after which a separate proof-only singleton promotion may bind the Soft Dark Theme, resolution, tokens, fragment, and deterministic builder into the existing `flavor.soft` proof record. The proof promotion must not redeploy Pages.
