# NeoSmartUI Core — Component Registry Contract v1

Core Components are generic UI capabilities that can be described accurately without naming a business domain.

The registry is an authority surface, not a marketing count. A component MUST NOT be listed as implemented or publicly proven until matching evidence exists in the same repository state.

## Admission law

A Core component MUST:

1. be business-domain-neutral;
2. have a stable `core.<name>` ID;
3. publish a machine-readable `neosmartui/component@1` contract;
4. declare all semantic-token dependencies;
5. define state semantics before visual implementation;
6. define keyboard, touch, RTL, reduced-motion, and forced-colors support expectations;
7. preserve permanent tactile laws where interactive;
8. avoid Flavor-specific values or Vertical business semantics;
9. expose honest maturity/proof status in the registry.

If a capability cannot satisfy these rules yet, it is a `REGISTRY GAP`, not permission to invent a local substitute.

## Registry maturity

The first registry uses three explicit maturity states:

- `contract-only` — semantic/state/token contract exists; no implementation claim.
- `implemented` — a canonical implementation exists and is quality-validated.
- `public-proof` — the canonical implementation is represented by live/public proof derived from the same source.

Promotion between states requires evidence. Tooling MUST reject a maturity claim whose evidence is absent.

## First slice: `core.button`

`core.button` is the first Core component because it exercises the permanent interaction laws without requiring business-domain semantics.

The contract requires:

```text
rest
hover
focus-visible
pressed
loading
disabled
```

The visual implementation is intentionally deferred until a Theme can resolve concrete token values and an adapter can render platform output. That prevents Core from smuggling a default Flavor into generic component code.
